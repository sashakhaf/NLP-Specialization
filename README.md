# NLP-Specialization
In Course 1 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization, offered by deeplearning.ai, in Coursera:
We learnt how to:
a) Perform sentiment analysis of tweets using logistic regression and then na√Øve Bayes, 
b) Use vector space models to discover relationships between words and use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships.

Here you will find how I implemented the assignements for course1 of this specialization.
